What's up people! My name is Ryan, and It's my first time in GitHub! I'm a kid just trying to make cool mods. I make FNF Mods with my friend, Eassah!
(He has a github and a YT channel! View these two here! https://github.com/Eassah and https://www.youtube.com/c/Eassah)
I kinda got here, for maybeee if I learn to actually make mods and not reskins of other mods in FNF, lmao.
And if I do... When I do, then I can upload the source codes here! :D
And, if you didn't know, I have a YT channel! So you can check it out here!
